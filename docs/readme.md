## Mountain Lion Club

This is the first puzzle that was created. It was completed and went through its first run on Sunday 6-Oct-2019.

### Hardware

- Dewalt Tough System DS 300 Toolbox
  - $45 Home Depot (Oct-2019)
- Speed Dial Master Lock
  - $8 Hope Depot (Oct-2019)
- Word Combination Master Lock
  - $8 Hope Depot (Oct-2019)
- High Security Deed Box
  - $40 Container Store (Oct-2019)
- Lockbox

### The Setup

The (toy) mountain lion cub was placed inside the deed box and locked with a key. The key was placed in the Lockbox and both of these, with the Lockbox clue page, were placed inside the Toolbox. The Toolbox was then locked with both the Speed Dial and Word Combo locks. The clues for the Speed Dial lock were placed inside a book between specific pages. The clue page to find the Speed Dial clues and the Cryptograms were then given to the participants.

### The Game

It took our two participants about an hour to make their way through to the end of the game.

### Improvements
