Once upon a time I went on a long hike in the forest. I started off by heading north and walked for miles and miles. Then I got to a lake. Because I was so hot and sweaty I decided to have a swim. Boy did that feel good. I dried myself off and then I headed around the lake. To do that I had to go east for exactly three miles. Then I was able to turn and go north again and finally came to the cabin that I was staying in that night. The next day, instead of tracing my steps backwards I decided to complete the circumnavigation of that lake so I went west for exactly 2 miles. The I went south and finally got back to the point where I started.
