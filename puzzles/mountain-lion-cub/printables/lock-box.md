Choose a four digit number where the digits are not all the same (that is not 1111, 2222, etc...).

Rearrange the digits to get the largest and smallest numbers these digits can make.

Finally, subtract the smallest number from the largest to get a new number.

Repeat this exercise for each new number.

At some point you will come across the answer.
