# The Mountain Lion Cub

Disaster! The mountain lion cub has been kidnapped and is being held prisoner somewhere.

Your challenge, if you chose to accept it, is to find and free the poor frightened cub before she runs out of oxygen.

You will need to search for clues and solve puzzles. Watch out for Red Herrings. (A Red Herring is something that looks like a clue but is not.)
