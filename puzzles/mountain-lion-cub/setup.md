## Clues

Getting into the first box involves solving three cryptograms. Two of the cryptograms have a common pattern of letters (first letter on each line) that provide the combination to the lock. The second cryptogram simply tells the participants that the other two cryptograms have a pattern.

A clue to the cryptograms is that they all use the same "key" combination. In other words if H is an A in one cryptogram then it's also an A in all the other cryptograms. This should help the participants if they get stuck or are struggling with the cryptograms.
