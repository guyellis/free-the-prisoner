## Contributing a Puzzle

If you want to improve an existing puzzle or make a new one then fork this repo and PR your changes.

You will make your changes in the `puzzles/` folder.

Use the `mountain-lion-cub/` folder as an example to base your puzzle. In fact if you just copy it and rename it to your puzzle you can then adjust it as you like.

## Contributing Code

The code that helps generate the puzzles is in the `lib/` folder.
